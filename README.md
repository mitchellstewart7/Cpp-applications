# Cpp-applications
This repository includes work done through CS courses at OSU to show knowledge of C++.

# Assignment 1
This assignment uses file I/O to make a catalog of wizards and the spells they can perform. Users are able to sort spellbooks, group spells by effect, and sort by avewrage success rate. This assignment also uses command line arguments as well as many other staples of C++. The .txt files are used for input data, while catalog.cpp contains most of the functions used in the program and run_wizard.cpp is the executable.
